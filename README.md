    This Project asks us to prompt a user with several options to generate a password that is based on input 
    from the user. 

    I accessed ASCII characters to make things cleaner in the js, insead of creating arrays of uppercase, lowercase, and
    special characters. I was able to call these values using fromCharCode.

    The most interesting part about this homework, was the way in which i was tasked to compile if-statements that would satisfy the components of the generate button. 

    I used html, css, and javascript to compile this project. 

    The system involves defining variables to hold specific data that's compiled through prompts. the user's input , if made to satisfy all criteria, will be presented in a random password that includes all the 
    input criteria.
