    This Project asks us to prompt a user with several options to generate a password that is based on input 
    from the user. 

    I accessed ASCII characters to make things cleaner in the js, insead of creating arrays of uppercase, lowercase, and
    special characters. I was able to call these values using fromCharCode.

    The most interesting part about this homework, was the way in which i was tasked to compile if-statements that would satisfy the components of the generate button. 

    I used html, css, and javascript to compile this project. 

    The system involves defining variables to hold specific data that's compiled through prompts. the user's input , if made to satisfy all criteria, will be presented in a random password that includes all the 
    input criteria. 

    User progress: 

    when the user clicks on the generate passsword button, they are prompted with a window prompt, stating taht passwords can be between 8 or 128 characters. They are asked if they want uppercase and lowercase characters, as well as special characters. When the user selects the approptiate amount of characters, then answers "true" to the boolean criteria, a function triggers, to generate a password using all the characters they've agreed to.
